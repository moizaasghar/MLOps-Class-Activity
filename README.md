# MLOps-Class-Activity
In this class activity, pairs created a GitHub repo with `dev`, `test`, and `master` branches, plus individual branches for each member. We scaffolded a Python project, updated the `README` with Git commands, and made the repo public. This hands-on task reinforced Git skills and collaborative development practices.
